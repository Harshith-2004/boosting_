This data is about a spam detection task. The dataset contains 4601 instances, with 1813 (39.4%) being spam and 2788 (60.6%) being non-spam. Each instance has 58 attributes, 57 of which are continuous and 1 is a nominal class label indicating whether the email is spam (1) or not (0).

The attributes include:

48 attributes representing the frequency of specific words in the email.
6 attributes representing the frequency of specific characters in the email.
3 attributes related to the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters: average length, longest length, and total length.
There are no missing attribute values in the dataset.

The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify an email as spam or not. In previous usage, a model built on this data achieved a misclassification error of around 7%. However, false positives (marking good mail as spam) were considered very undesirable. If insisting on zero false positives, 20-25% of the spam passed through the filter.
